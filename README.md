# Resources
##AudioPlayer
(http://osvaldas.info/audio-player-responsive-and-touch-friendly)
The audioplayer plugin is found at the bottom of the music section on the home page. When you press play, the cantina band music from the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in Episode IV will play. You can skip ahead or back, play and pause, and control the volume.
##Fresco
(http://www.frescojs.com/)
The fresco plugin is a lightbox plugin found on the gallery page. You can find two sets of images, one of the interior of the cantina, and the others are a few images of drinks served at the bar.
*Please Note - The max-width media queries are from the fresco.css, for gallery images on mobile - not my own code. I tried to see if I could re-write is without, but I think it was going to be really complicated.
##MeanMenu
(http://www.meanthemes.com/plugins/meanmenu/)
The MeanMenu plugin takes the navigation, and condenses it on mobile devices. By clicking the "hamburger" or 3 lines in the top-right corner, it opens up the navigation. This plugin gets rid of the clutter in the navigation while viewing the site on a cell phone.

This link is related to the audioplayer plugin, which gives some tips for making edits to the css stylings.

I needed this site to fill out the robust menu page.
