                        <p>An extremely rare, fermented alcoholic ale, brewed from fragrant grains once native to Alderaan. It had a smooth, rich flavor</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="menu-item">Corellian Strong Ale - <span class="credit">$9</span></p>
                        <p>A strong take on the Galaxy's favorite style of ale. Fresh shipments of this sweet, medium-bodied ale arrive weekly, directly from Corellia</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="menu-item">Fermented Fungus Ale - <span class="credit">$13</span></p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="menu-item">Huttese Ale - <span class="credit">$14</span></p>
                        <p>Beware of this potent beverage. At 29% ABV, this ale is as repugnant as it is strong, just the way the Hutts like it</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="menu-item">Kashyyyk Ale - <span class="credit">$6</span></p>
                        <p>Chalmun's own special brew. Strong enough for a Wookie, but tasty enough for a humanoid</p>

                        <p>If you've never tried it, then you probably don't want to get too experimental with this one. An acidic ale that only Rodian's seem to enjoy.</p>

                        <p>A rare, technically illegal beverage. It is so strong, just a little taste has been known to put some hair on your chest... and your legs, arms, back and everywhere else. We can serve it, but it's illegal to drink, so if you see an Imperial, drink it up quick, you're on your own.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
